# Code Refactor

I have refactored the code by meeting the standards in web accessibility as well as followed the scout rule. While improving the codebase for longer sustainability I have also verified that the links are working appropriately.

CSS selectors were consolidated to be more efficient. CSS was also cleaned up to follow the structure of the HTML file, including comments.
